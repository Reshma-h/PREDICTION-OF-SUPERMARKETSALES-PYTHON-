# PREDICTION-OF-SUPERMARKETSALES-PYTHON-
Predicted the accuracy of supermarket sales using python
The objective of this project is to build a machine learning model that can predict
the sales of a supermarket based on various factors such as the product line, unit
price, quantity, and customer ratings. By building this model, we can gain insights
into which factors influence sales the most and how we can improve sales
performance.
