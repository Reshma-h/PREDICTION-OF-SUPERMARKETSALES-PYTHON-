# PREDICTION-OF-SUPERMARKETSALES-PYTHON-
Predicted the accuracy of supermarket sales using python
The objective of this project is to build a machine learning model that can predict
the sales of a supermarket based on various factors such as the product line, unit
price, quantity, and customer ratings. By building this model, we can gain insights
into which factors influence sales the most and how we can improve sales
performance.

Project Title: Predicting the Sales of a Supermarket
Project Overview
The objective of this project is to build a machine learning model that can predict
the sales of a supermarket based on various factors such as the product line, unit
price, quantity, and customer ratings. By building this model, we can gain insights
into which factors influence sales the most and how we can improve sales
performance.
Data Description
The data contains 1000 rows and the following columns:
● Invoice ID: Unique identifier for each invoice
● Branch: The branch of the supermarket (A, B, or C)
● City: The city where the branch is located
● Customer Type: The type of customer (Member or Normal)
● Gender: The gender of the customer (Male or Female)
● Product Line: The product category (Electronic accessories, Fashion
accessories, Food and beverages, Health and beauty, Home and lifestyle,
Sports and travel)
● Unit Price: The price of each unit of the product
● Quantity: The quantity of the product sold
● Tax 5%: The amount of tax added to the product
● Total: The total amount of the sale (including tax)
● Date: The date of the sale
● Time: The time of the sale
● Payment: The payment method used (Cash, Credit card, or E-wallet)
● COGS: Cost of Goods Sold
● Gross Margin Percentage: The percentage of the profit margin
● Gross Income: The gross income generated by the sale
● Rating: The customer rating of the supermarket (1 to 10)
Project Goals
The goals of this project are to:
● Build a machine learning model that can predict the sales of a supermarket
● Identify the factors that influence sales the most
● Provide recommendations for improving sales performance
Project Steps
1. Load the data into a pandas DataFrame
2. Perform exploratory data analysis to gain insights into the data
3. Preprocess the data (e.g., handle missing values, convert categorical
variables to numerical)
4. Split the data into training and testing sets
5. Select and train a machine learning model (e.g., linear regression, decision
tree, random forest)
6. Evaluate the performance of the model using metrics such as mean
squared error, mean absolute error, and R-squared
7. Interpret the coefficients of the model to identify the factors that influence
sales the most
8. Use the model to make predictions on new data and provide
recommendations for improving sales performance
Technologies Used
● Python
● Pandas (for data preprocessing)
● Scikit-learn (for machine learning)
● Matplotlib and Seaborn (for data visualization)
Project Deliverables
● Python code for data preprocessing, machine learning model selection and
training, and data visualization
● Jupyter Notebook containing the project documentation and code
● A presentation summarizing the project and its findings
Assumptions and Limitations
● The data is representative of the sales patterns of the supermarket
● The factors included in the model are sufficient to accurately predict sales
● The model's performance may be limited by factors not included in the
data, such as seasonality or competition from other supermarkets
● The recommendations provided by the model may be limited by the scope
of the data and may require additional research and analysis
